The Nile Integrated Linux Environment, or N.I.L.E., is a highly in-development system management framework for Linux-based operating systems.

The documentation for the entirety of the N.I.L.E. is too big to fit on one singular page. Because of this, it [has its own dedicated website](https://nile.entertheduat.org).
