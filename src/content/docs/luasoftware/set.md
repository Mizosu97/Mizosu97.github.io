**Source Code:** [Github](https://github.com/mizosu97/wedjat)

Set is a Lua library that easily lets you create your own TUI applications.

It doesn't have all of the features I would like it to have yet, though it's completely functional where it stands today.

Documentation for implementing Set into a program of your own will be written when there is time. For now, look at the example programs in the Github repository.
