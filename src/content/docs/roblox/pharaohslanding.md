Pharaoh's Landing combines [Egomoose's gravity module](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/wall-stickgravity-controller/432598) and some old baseball bat script commonly used in Roblox exploits into a unique round-based PVP game, in which the main objective is to knock the other players off of the map to be the last person standing.


Notable features:

- A round-based last-man-standing PVP system on randomly selected maps.

- An in-game shop to purchase new weapon skins with currency earned from winning matches.


Future plans:

- More weapon skins.

- More maps.

- A congruent aesthetic for the game.

- Bug fixes.
