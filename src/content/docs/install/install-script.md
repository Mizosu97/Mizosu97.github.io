Since the NILE is not fully released yet, this installation guide walks you through installing the developer version of the NILE. The developer version does not have a release cycle, it is updated every time new code is written to the codebase. Because of this, it is highly unstable and may break your system.

The Nile Integrated Linux Environment can be easily installed onto any supported Linux system via the installation script.
