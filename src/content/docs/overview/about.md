**The NILE is currently still in development. It is usable, but may contain bugs.**
**This site, and the system itself, are currently in the process of going through a rebrand. Expect inconsistencies.**


This is the Duat, the home and birthplace of the Nile Integrated Linux Environment (N.I.L.E.)

The **Nile Integrated Linux Environment**, or NILE, is an Arch Linux-based Meta Distribution designed with the intention of bringing simplicity and uniformity to the Linux desktop. This is done through a series of programs, scripts, configurations, and tweaks collectively known as the **Nile River**. The Nile River provides a sort of wrapper that facilitates actions between the User and the underlying Arch Linux system, which provides a uniform operating system no matter the base system the NILE is installed onto. There are multiple frontends you can use to interact with the Nile River, the most up-to-date being the Duat's own frontend, simply called **River**.

Because of its design, nearly every Arch Linux based distribution can be converted into a NILE system, although, it is best supported on vanilla Arch Linux. Some functions provided by the Nile River, such as its service management tools, will work on systems using the Runit or OpenRC init systems. However, other capabilities, such as dual-GPU management, are locked to systemd. Because of this design, an Arch+NILE system will look, function, and feel almost identical to a Manjaro+NILE system or an EndeavorOS+NILE system. The NILE allows you to have a uniform user experience throughout, while forgetting about the underlying software making up the base Linux distribution.


## What the NILE IS

- A wrapper for Arch Linux distributions, facilitating actions between the User and the underlying Arch Linux system.

- A Meta-Distribution, providing a certain kind of system by means other than an ISO image.

- A platform, in which each instance of the NILE will be more or less the same as any other, no matter the underlying system.


## What the NILE ISN'T

- A fully complete, seperate, standalone Linux distribution.

- A fork of Arch Linux.

- A Desktop Environment.

- An i3 rice.

- A "Do It Yourself" distribution. Other than the various configurations provided, the NILE is meant to be used relatively as-is. If you want a fully customizable system, install vanilla Arch Linux.
