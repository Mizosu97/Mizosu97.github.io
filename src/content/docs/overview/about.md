description: What is the Nile Integrated Linux Environment?

**The NILE is currently still in development. It is usable, but may contain bugs.**
**This site, and the system itself, are currently in the process of going through a rebrand. Expect inconsistencies.**


The Nile Integrated Linux Environment, or NILE, is a system management framework for Linux-based operating systems that allows you to easily use any Linux distribution without knowing the ins and outs of the system's distribution-specific software.

The Nile Integrated Linux Environment manages to do this by providing a set of tools that act as a wrapper for the underlying Linux distribution. Rather than needing to learn how to use multiple package managers or multiple init systems to use different distributions, you can simply learn the tools provided by the NILE. The NILE provides a simple and clear user interface that is consistent across different Linux systems.


## Features

- A pre-configured i3 Window Manager installation.

- Tools for displaying system information.

- System configuration utilities.

- Init system management tools.

- A software management utility.

- Plugins, Themes, and a package manager to install them.

- A predefined set of desktop applications, such as a file manager and web browser.

- More to come.


## Use Cases

- If you use multiple Linux distributions frequently, the NILE can eliminate the hassle that comes with needing to manage multiple systems.

- A distrohopper can use the NILE to alleviate the discomfort caused by learning a completely different system every week.

- If you are new to Linux-based operating systems, the NILE can enable you to use the more "advanced" distributions without getting into the nitty-gritty.
