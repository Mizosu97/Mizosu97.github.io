description: How do I use the mizOS user interface?
---

**This page will be going through a heavy rework when time is available.**

By default, mizOS comes with i3 - an extremely fast/lightweight user interface. mizOS is tightly integrated into i3, giving it abilities never before seen in any other Linux distribution.

Rather than being a "point and click" user interface, i3 is keyboard-oriented, meaning you mainly navigate it by using a set of keyboard shortcuts. This may seem a bit hard to learn at first, but it's not that difficult once you start using it.


In mizOS, i3 uses "Mod4" as the default "Mod" key. Mod4 refers to the [Windows key](https://cdsmythe.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Insert-Windows-Key-Symbol.jpg).

If you don't know how to navigate i3, follow the reference card [here](https://i3wm.org/docs/refcard.html).

mizOS makes some changes to i3 via a custom config file. These changes are listed below:

- i3 has been fully themed in the mizOS style by default.
- MOD+shift+a now lets you take a screenshot, the image will be saved to your clipboard.
- MOD+shift+m enables Picom for some fancy visual effects.
- MOD+shift+n disables Picom.
