Donation Depot is a clone of the popular game [Pls Donate](https://www.roblox.com/games/8737602449/PLS-DONATE), in which players create stands to beg for money.


Contributions to the game:

- Stand claim and ownership system.

- A system that scans the player's inventory for on-sale items. System bypasses Roblox's "private inventory" security setting.

- A global leaderboard, as well as a game-wide live donations feed.

- An automatically updating in-game shop for the game owner's personal UGC and merchandise.
