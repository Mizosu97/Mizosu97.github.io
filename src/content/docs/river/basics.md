The core of the NILE is made up of a collection of programs and files referred to as the Nile River. The Nile River does all of the behind-the-scenes work - configuring your system, managing installed software, performing system updates, etc. Users of a NILE system can interact with the Nile River by using a program called a "frontend". A frontend is a small interactable program that executes code stored in the Nile River. It is the frontend's responsibility to provide a clear and intuitive portal to the Nile River.

Frontends for the Nile River can come in all shapes and sizes. By default, the NILE ships with a command-line frontend called `river`.


## Capabilities

Being the official frontend, `river` is the most up-to-date frontend available. It is generally capable of performing all actions that the Nile River has to offer.

`river` capabilities:

- Displaying information about your Linux system.
