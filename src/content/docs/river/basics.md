Users of a NILE system can manage their system by using a program generally referred to as a "frontend". A frontend is responsible for providing a clear and intuitive interface to the NILE's system management capabilities.

Frontends for the Nile Integrated Linux Environment can come in all shapes and sizes. By default, the NILE ships with a command-line frontend called **river**.


## Capabilities

Being the official frontend, river is the most up-to-date frontend available. It is generally capable of performing all system management actions that the NILE has to offer.

river capabilities:

- Displaying information about your Linux system.

- Configuring system settings, such as the look of the user interface.

- Managing your init system. (Supports systemd, runit, and openrc)

- Graphics card and Dual-GPU management.

- Wi-Fi and network management.

- Installing, removing, and updating software.

- Performing system updates.

- And more to come!
