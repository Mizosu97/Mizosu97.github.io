## System updates

Easily update your system through the `miz` frontend.

- `miz update` - Updates mizOS, Pacman packages, and AUR packages.

- `miz update dev` - Same as `miz update`, except it updates to the lastest developer edition. This is used solely for development purposes, and may break your system.

**Warning: While updating, mizOS will replace your configurations in /var/mizOS/config/$USER/ with an updated set. Your old confifurations will be located in /var/mizOS/backup/$USER/. If you want to restore your previous settings, please see [this page](https://the-duat.github.io/miz/configuration/).**
